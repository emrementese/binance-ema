# Example connect to API & Info Functions

from binance.spot import Spot
from binancema.coininfo import *

KEY         = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
SECRET      = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

Client = Spot(KEY,SECRET)  # connect binance api

symbol = "OXT"
market = "OXTUSDT"

# use libary binancema functions
print(f"Your USDT ($) Balance:                  {balance_usdt(Client)} $\n")              #float

print(f"OXT Quantity (Free):                    {quantity_free(Client,symbol)} OXT\n")     #float

## Example Trade Functions
```py

from binance.spot import Spot

Client = Spot(KEY,SECRET)  # connect binance api

symbol = "OXT"
market = "OXTUSDT"

# TRADE with binance-ema
print(market_buy_with_price(Client, market,30))  # buy 30 $ BTC (market price)

print(market_buy_with_quantity(Client, market,0.01233)) # buy 0.01233 BTC (market price)

# default binance-connector functions
print(f"All Open Orders (LIMIT): {Client.get_open_orders()}\n") #list

print(f"OXT Open Orders (LIMIT): {Client.get_open_orders(market)}\n") #list

print(f"Get only 1 order:{Client.get_order(market,orderId = 55555)} \n") # dict (inpur order id gettin to get_open_orders)
