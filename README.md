* Trusted IP default null. You must add your ip adress here for your security. Other ip adress cannot read coins information or trade.

            You can use this libary now but you need original binance-connector libary for connect to your API.

## tests
```py

# example connect to API

from binance.spot import Spot
from binancema.indicators import indicator
from binancema.coininfo import *

KEY         = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
SECRET      = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

Client = Spot(KEY,SECRET)  # connect binance api
functions = indicator(Client) #connect the binance-ema libary

# default binance-connector
print(f"Server Time: {Client.time()['serverTime']}")

# use libary binancema
print(f"Your USDT ($) Balance:                  {balance_usdt(Client)} $")
print(f"OXT Quantity (Free):                    {quantity_free(Client,'OXT')} OXT")
print(f"OXT Quantity (locked):                  {quantity_locked(Client,'OXT')} OXT")
print(f"OXT Quantity (all):                     {quantity_all(Client,'OXT')} OXT")
print(f"OXT Balance ($) (free):                 {balance_free(Client,'OXT')} $")
print(f"OXT Balance ($) (locked):               {balance_locked(Client,'OXT')} $")
print(f"OXT Balance ($) (all):                  {balance_all(Client,'OXT')} $")
print(f"OXT/USDT Price (now):                   {price(Client,'OXTUSDT')}")
print(f"OXT/USDT Price (before 24hr):           {price_before_24hr(Client,'OXTUSDT')}")
print(f"OXT/USDT Price Change Value (24hr):     {price_change24(Client,'OXTUSDT')}")
print(f"OXT/USDT Price Change (%) (24hr):       % {price_change_percent24(Client,'OXTUSDT')}") 
print(f"OXT/USDT Price High Value (24hr):       {price_high24(Client,'OXTUSDT')}") 
print(f"OXT/USDT Price Low Value (24hr):        {price_low24(Client,'OXTUSDT')}")
